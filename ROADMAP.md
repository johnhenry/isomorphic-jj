# isomorphic-jj Roadmap

**Current Version**: v0.2 Complete ✅  
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-30

---

## Version Overview

This roadmap outlines the planned features and improvements for isomorphic-jj. v0.1 MVP and v0.2 are complete. Each future version builds incrementally, following semantic versioning and the constitutional principle of complete features before release.

---

## v0.1 MVP - ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal**: Core JJ experience with stable change IDs, no staging, complete undo, and bookmarks

### Delivered Features ✅
- ✅ Change-centric model with stable change IDs
- ✅ Operation log for complete undo/redo
- ✅ Change operations (init, describe, new, status)
- ✅ Revset queries: @, all(), ancestors(), direct change ID lookup
- ✅ Bookmarks for named pointers
- ✅ Isomorphic operation (Node + browser with mock backend)
- ✅ No staging area (working copy is the change)

### Success Criteria Met ✅
- ✅ 90%+ test coverage (113 tests, 100% passing)
- ✅ Works in Node.js
- ✅ Repository with changes performs adequately
- ✅ Complete undo/redo functionality

### Test Coverage ✅
- 113 tests across 11 test suites
- 102 unit tests, 11 integration tests
- 100% pass rate

---

## v0.2 - Advanced Operations - ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal**: History editing, enhanced revsets, and advanced change manipulation

### Delivered Features ✅

#### History Editing Operations ✅
- ✅ `squash()`: Combine multiple changes into one
- ✅ `split()`: Split a change into multiple changes
- ✅ `move()`: Move changes to different parents (rebase)
- ✅ `abandon()`: Mark changes as abandoned (hide from log)
- ✅ `restore()`: Restore abandoned changes

#### Enhanced Revset Functions ✅
- ✅ `author(pattern)`: Filter by author
- ✅ `description(pattern)`: Filter by commit message
- ✅ `empty()`: Changes with empty diff

#### All Operations ✅
- ✅ Fully integrated with operation log
- ✅ Complete undo/redo support
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage

### Success Criteria Met ✅
- ✅ All history editing operations implemented
- ✅ Enhanced revset filtering functional
- ✅ All operations reversible
- ✅ Test coverage maintained (113 tests passing)

### Criteria for 1.0
- Complete revset language parity with JJ
- All core operations stable and tested
- Comprehensive documentation
- Migration tools for all versions
- 95%+ test coverage
- Performance benchmarks met
